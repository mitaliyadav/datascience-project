Yet somehow at the age of 18, my parent allowed me to come to USA to pursue higher education, and they live in constant fear. I feel if there was a way of knowing whether the neighborhood I'm about to enter is safe at that time, it would greatly assuage their fears.\n\nSo for this project, I would like to create a model to predict whether a neighborhood is safe at a particular time of the day. The location chosen for this project is Oakland, since I frequently travel to Oakland and use the BART. I would like to use a prediction model, but haven't yet decided on a particular algorithm. "
